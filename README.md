# swrpg-unit-4-game

1. This game starts by displaying 4 star war's charecters, each with their own health point displaying under their name
2. Once the user clicks on a charecter, it becomes his/her charenter and every other charecters move to the "enemies" section
3. Now the user can select a defender from these enemies and the defender will move to the fight section
4. The user and the defendar has the Attack Point & Counter Attack Points respectively.
5. Every time the user clicks on the attack button, it will substract his AP from the defendar's HP and substract defendar's CAP from his HP
6. With every attack, the users AP will increase in arithmatic progression i.e. if the AP was 5 the first time, it will become 10,15,20 with 
each subsequent attact. However, the defendar's CAP will remain constant.
7. If the user's HP becomes <= 0, the user will lose and the user can click on "Restart" button to play again
8. If the defendar's HP becomes <= 0, the user will win that round and he/she can select another defendar from the "enemies" section and continue to play
as long as there are any enimes left.
9. Once the user defeats all enemies, he/she wins the game and can hit "Restart" to play again.
